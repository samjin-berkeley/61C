### <a name = "first"></a>61C from a 61A Perspective
Just as in the case of software, computer hardware developers with the idea of abstraction to enable greater complexity and generality. 
- Digital Domain: There's abstraction at work within hardware deisgn itself. Fanouts are the number of circuits that can be allowed to read a given circuit's output before votalge reading might interpret it as a low voltage happens. In the digital abstraction, we pretend there are no intermediate voltages, and we think about fanout contraints seperactely. 
- An Example: Number Representations 
  - Consider the history of number representation. Some earlier computers used a different representation than binary (in which each bit represents a power of two). It was called BCD (Binary Coded Decimal). In this system, each decimal digit of a human-readable numeral is directly encoded using four bits
